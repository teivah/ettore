# Majorana

[Majorana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Majorana) is a set of open-source RISC-V cores written in Rust.

## Majorana Virtual Machine (MVM)

### MVM-1

MVM-1 is the first virtual machine implementation.
It does not implement any of the known CPU optimizations like pipelining, out-of-order execution, multiple execution units, etc.

MVM-1 is the starting point to build more advanced virtual machines.
